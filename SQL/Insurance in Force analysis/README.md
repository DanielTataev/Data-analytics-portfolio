# Insurance In Force Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview
Collecting and cleaning data from multiple sources and tables on mortgage insurance applications for the past 30 years of operation in order to create a self-service dashboard in PowerBI for stakeholders

## Technologies Used
- The tools and technologies used, such as:
  - Python
  - SQL
  - Power BI
    
## Challenges & Solutions
Over the past 30 years, data has been stored in various formats and used different coding practices, all of which needed to be standardized and processed to create a cohesive and uniform dataset. Utilized Python and SQL for modifying and testing large datasets to ensure they met the required formats and conditions, which were later used in a dashboard for visualization and analysis.

## Key Insights/Results
The dashboard was designed for analyzing historical patterns in insurance applications, tracking their trends and changes over time. It included yearly and quarterly drop-off rate calculations to help predict future developments in insured applications. Additionally, the dashboard provided breakdowns by geography, lender, product, and borrower, enabling a detailed deep dive into business performance and risk analysis.
