# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Revenue and Actor Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes movie data to answer three key questions:

1. **Gross of a Movie vs. Directors**: Which directors are associated with the highest-grossing movies?
2. **Actor Genre Preference**: Which genre do actors prefer based on the number of movies they appear in?
3. **Actor Combinations and Gross**: Which combinations of actors are linked to the highest-grossing movies?

The analysis uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to clean, process, and visualize the data.
